I am a researcher, community organizer, and R educator. My research leverages electronic health record data to study pregnancy-related outcomes, and my organizing values data literacy as a way to build power and effect change.

I enjoy finding ways to communicate technical knowledge with a variety of audiences and love showing others how to leverage xaringan to create effective, reproducible, and beautiful presentations. I have taught xaringan workshops in both English and Spanish to R users across disciplines:
+ [Sharing Your Work with xaringan](https://silvia.rbind.io/project/xaringan-nhs-r/) is a four hour workshop created for the 2020 NHS-R Community Conference.
+ [Introducción al Paquete xaringan](https://silvia.rbind.io/talk/2020-12-17-introduccion-xaringan/) is a two hour workshop created for R-Ladies Xalapa

I have also contributed a [custom NHS-R CSS theme](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/pull/280) to the xaringan package. The theme was designed with input from the NHS-R Community to meet [NHS identity guidelines](https://www.england.nhs.uk/nhsidentity/identity-guidelines/).
