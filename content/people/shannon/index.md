I'm currently a Statistician at Adelphi Research in Doylestown, PA working in pharmaceutical market research; previously, I was an Assistant Professor of Statistics at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.  

My day-to-day in R include: fine-tuning ggplots to convey analysis results, contributing to an internal package to automate analyses, and developing shiny aps.
