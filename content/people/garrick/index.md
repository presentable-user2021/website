I'm a Data Science Educator and R developer for [RStudio].
I use R, [R Markdown][rmarkdown], [Shiny], and the tools of data science to make it easier to teach and learn data science with R,
primarily through my work supporting the [learnr] and [gradethis] packages.

I am passionate about making great-looking, interactive presentations with R Markdown and the [xaringan].
I've created two packages that help you take your slides to the next level:

- [xaringanthemer] creates a complete xaringan theme starting from only one or two colors
- [xaringanExtra] adds interactivity and extensions that make your presentations better and more effective.

I've also contributed to the [xaringan] package and other R packages in the xaringan ecosystem.

And for the most recent thing I've learned (and want to remember), you can find me online at [garrickadenbuie.com](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com).
