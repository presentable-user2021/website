Welcome to the [Professional, Polished, Presentable](/) workshop! We look forward to meeting you. 

This is an intermediate workshop designed for R learners already familiar with the [xaringan](/packages/xaringan/) package for building presentations. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.

## Bring a style guide

We will be using the [xaringanthemer](/packages/xaringanthemer) package to create a style sheet to match the style guide preferred or required by your organization, institution, or company.

### Find your style guide

Ask the marketing department at your company for a _branding guide_ or _design guide_.
Typically these are posted on internal web pages.
If you work with a large organization
you may be able to find a style guide by searching online for your company or organization's name 
plus the terms *style*, *design*, or *branding guide*.
  
Alternatively, you can find [examples of style guides](https://policyviz.com/2016/11/30/style-guides/) online.
Choose one that matches your design aspirations.
  
Here are a few that we like:
  
- [GOV.UK Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/) is excellent.
  Their [Styles page](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/) is a great place to start.
  
- The [Urban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide](http://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/) 
  provides solid design advice, especially for charts and graphs.
  
- The [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) 
  is a treasure trove of design advice and knowledge. 
  Their page on [Design tokens](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-tokens/) 
  is a good place to start looking for color and typography recommendations.

### Explore the style guide

Explore the style guide, asking yourself:

- What colors does it use and in what contexts?

- What fonts does it recommend for **headings** and **body** text?

    - Does the guide recommend specific fonts for screens or the web?
    
### Bring the guide with you

Have this style guide easily available during the workshop so you can refer to it as needed.

## Set up RStudio Cloud

Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. We recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). We want you to be able to work from your own computer and preferred IDE in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.

## Review markdown

Please complete this [10-minute interactive tutorial on Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

## Review xaringan

Please review the [xaringan](/packages/xaringan/) package documentation and/or chapter of the R Markdown book. [xaringan chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) of the R Markdown book.
