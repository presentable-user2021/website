Welcome to the [Professional, Polished, Presentable](/) workshop! We look forward to meeting you. 

This is an intermediate workshop designed for R learners already familiar with the [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan#xaringan) package for building presentations. Before attending the workshop, please complete the following prework.

Reminder to talk about this:
> ## Set up RStudio Cloud

> Sign up for a free RStudio Cloud account at https://rstudio.cloud/ before the workshop. We recommend logging in with an existing Google or GitHub account, if you have one (rather than creating a new account with another password you have to remember). We want you to be able to work from your own computer and preferred IDE in this workshop, but Cloud is an important back-up plan should you run into troubles.

## Set up GitHub

We will be using GitHub in this workshop for version control and publishing. Sign up for a free GitHub.com account at <https://github.com/join> if you don't already have one. Also:

+ Complete these [installation instructions](https://happygitwithr.com/install-intro.html).
    
+ Test your connection between GitHub and RStudio following [these steps](https://happygitwithr.com/connect-intro.html). 
    
+ **NOTE:** We *strongly recommend* that if you are not already a fluent GitHub user you choose [HTTPS over SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html).

## Review markdown

Please complete this [10-minute interactive tutorial on Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/).

## Review xaringan

Please review the [xaringan documentation](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1) and/or the [xaringan chapter](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html) of the R Markdown book.

## Installations

Please bring a computer that has the following installed:

+ A recent version of R (>=3.6.0), which is available for free at https://cloud.r-project.org/
    
+ A recent version of RStudio Desktop (>=1.4), available for free ([RStudio Desktop Open Source License](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)). Read up on the latest version [here](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/01/19/announcing-rstudio-1-4/).
    
+ The R packages we will use, which you can install by connecting to the internet and running the following at the command line:

    ```r
    > install.packages(c("xaringan",
                         "xaringanExtra",
                         "xaringanthemer",
                         "usethis",
                         "rmarkdown"))
    ```
