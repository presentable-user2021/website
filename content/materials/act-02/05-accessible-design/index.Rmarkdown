Add alternative text (alt-text) to the image in the slide

How-to reminders:

- Markdown: `![alt text goes here](image url goes here)`

- R Markdown code chunk:

    ````
    ```{r, fig.alt = "alt text goes here"}`r ''`
    knitr::include_graphics("image url goes here")
    ```
    ````

Make sure the link text makes sense on its own

Ask yourself:

- Are any of the links ambiguous? E.g. "More," "Continue"

- How could these links be rewritten to be descriptive?

Check color contrast of the `primary_color` and `secondary_color` selected for your style guide

For example:

```r
style_duo_accent(
  primary_color = "#035AA6",
  secondary_color = "#03A696"
)
```

Color contrast checking tools:

- **Recommended:** [Contrast Checker by WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). We like this tool because the site itself is designed to be accessible and the tool gives you the ability to adjust the color lightness.

- [A11y Rocks! Color Palette Tool by Matt Long](http://a11yrocks.com/colorPalette/). This tool helps you check the color contrast of multiple colors at once and displays the color contrast ratio for each combination.

- [Accessible color palette builder by Atul Varma](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/). This tool also helps you check multiple color contrasts at once and its minimalist design emphasizes only the combinations that meet color contrast guidelines.

[Color contrast ratio](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/#ratio) guidelines:

- WCAG level AAA (enhanced): At least **7:1** for normal text and **4.5:1** for large text

- WCAG level AA (minimum): **4.5:1** for normal text and **3:1** for large text
