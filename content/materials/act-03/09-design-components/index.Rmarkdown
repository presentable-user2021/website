## Topic

Create consistency with reusable design components.

To motivate: an activity inspired by [Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/): compare two slides on the screen. Which one looks "most correct"? (I think this activity would fit a little better in #7 but I could use it here, too)

How can we create consistency and re-usability?

1. At the _text_ level
	- Using markdown or inline classes, esp color classes, like `.yellow[word]` 
	- ðŸ‘‰ Rely on xaringanthemer and be consistent with structure.
2. At the _block_ level
    - Boxes or groups of content that appear on the slide
    - ðŸ‘‰ Write CSS classes (maybe more than one class!)
3. At the _slide_ level
    - When the whole slide is a little different
    - E.g. the `header_background` from xaringanthemer
    - ðŸ‘‰ Write a slide-level CSS class in combination with `layout: true` and `template` from remark

## Activity

Time: `r emo::ji("stopwatch")` 10 minutes

Open and preview this slide deck: materials/act-03/09-design-components.Rmd

Two options (attendees will pick one to work on)

1. Create a quote with attribution box â€” large quote text, small attribution text
    - Write a CSS `.quote` and `.attribution` class
2. Create a slide template for a slide with an image on the right
    - Slide-level CSS for `.image-sidebar-right` and `.image-sidebar-right .attribution`
    - Template slide using remark variables for the image and attribution details
