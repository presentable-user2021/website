Replace the alt-text in slide 3

Slide 3 of the deck talks about how common black lemurs are sexually dichromatic and contains two images, one of a male lemur and another of a female lemur to show the differences.

Replace some alt-text that is not informative in that context with alt-text that better matches the information being conveyed.

In the slide titled "Common black lemurs are sexually dichromatic," **replace the following alt-text** in the HTML code:

```html
alt = "Common black lemur with a millipede in one hand
and flies hovering overhead"
```

With this alternative that better matches the information being conveyed:

```html
alt = "Female common black lemur with brown-orange fur 
and white ear tufts"
```
