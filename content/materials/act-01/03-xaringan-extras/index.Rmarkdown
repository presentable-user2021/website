    - `knitr::fig_chunk("<label>", "<ext>")`
- xaringanExtra
	- Panelsets (segue from above)

	- extra css

## Activity

Time: `r emo::ji("stopwatch")` 10 minutes

Open and preview this slide deck: materials/act-01/03-xaringan-extras.Rmd

- Start with slides that have code, a scatter plot and a line plot (scatter + regression)
- Dress up slides with panelset to flip between the three
- Add scribble and turn it into a guess-the-regression game
