## Topic

Create a complete theme for xaringan based on your institution or organization's style guide

- xaringanthemer helps you build a complete set of styles for your slides
    - Start with one or two colors: `style_duo_*` or `style_mono_*`
    - The rest of the function name describes how those colors create the starting theme
    - The defaults are a starting point
- The xaringanthemer template helps during the process and includes examples of nearly every slide component.
- How to use xaringanthemer
    - (these things are done for you in the template)
	- Set `css: xaringan-themer.css` in the YAML header
	- Call `style_*` in an R chunk
	- OR create the `xaringan-themer.css` file in a separate R script
- Translating a style guide to slides: keep it simple
	- Recreate the look and feel, but it doesn't need to be perfect
	- Don't use _every color_ or _every font_
    	- Example slides that uses every color in the palette
    	- Example slides that use just one (or two) colors for emphasis
	- Strive for visual consistency

Time: `r emo::ji("stopwatch")` 10 minutes

Open and preview this slide deck: materials/act-01/02-style-guide.Rmd

This activity can be a bit longer with a guide to move participants through

1. Bring your own style guide (or use one of our favorites)
1. Create a new R Markdown document from xaringanthemer's _Ninja Themed Presentation_ template.
    - I might put the template in the starter kit with a note that you can get to the same place using the R Markdown template.
1. **Colors**: Use your style guide to pick _one_ or _two_ primary colors to be used throughout your slides.
    - Is one color dominant? Try `style_mono_accent()`
    - Are two colors commonly paired together? Try `style_duo_accent()`.
1. **Typography**: style guides typically prescribe specific fonts for headings and text body.
    - Which fonts does your style guide recommend?
    - Sans serif fonts are typically easier to read on screens and at a distance. If your style guide uses both serif and sans serif fonts, try to use serif for the headings. Keep in mind that you can deviate a little for the sake of legibility.
    - Find your recommended fonts on https://fonts.google.com (or a font that is close)
    - Use the `_font_google` arguments of the `style_` functions, together with `google_font()` to set the fonts for text, heading and code.
1. **More Colors**: Does your style guide include a palette?
    - Copy those colors into a named vector, e.g. `c("plum" = "#8B668B")`
    - Color names need to be one alpha-numeric word (plus `-` or `_`, but no `.`)
    - Pass the vector to the `colors` argument in `style_`
    - Use the color in your slides: `.plum[hello]`.
1. Explore the other arguments, change a few colors
2. Bonus: Use `theme_xaringan()` to create a plot that matches the theme
