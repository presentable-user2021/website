## Presenter Mode Tips

- The notes don't have to be just for you!

- If they are for you...

???

The notes in presenter mode aren't just to remind you of your script,
they can also be very helpful to others who find your slides online!

How can you view the presenter notes and share your screen at the same time?

### Presenting in video

1. .relative[Present from the private browser window .orange[without moon reader] <img src="assets/img/rstudio-viewer-popout.png" alt="RStudio Viewer Popout Button" class="v-btm" style="height: 52px;position: absolute;top: -10px;">]

3. Pick the full browser or the cloned window to share

4. Press <kbd>P</kbd> in the other window

Don't try to present from inside RStudio.
Instead, use a **private** browser window,
either from the slides shared online
or using the **knit** button.

Clone the slides into a new window and then choose either the small window or the full browser to share.
If you want people to only see the slides, share the cloned window.
If you want to share browser tabs, use the full browser.
