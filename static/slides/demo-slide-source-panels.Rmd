## What do you think?

The slides are actually in the deck in a later section.
I put them at the end in an "Appendix".

The source is pulled from the compiled source, so you can't see R Markdown bits.

.panel[.panel-name[Notes]

This slide doesn't look _perfect_ so somethings that rely on absolute positioning may be a little bit weird. Most basic xaringan stuff will probably look okay, though.

I had to manually make this **Source** panel because it includes an Rmd chunk.
