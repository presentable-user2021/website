Think about your favorite song?
How long would it take you to recognize it?
From the first note?
When you hear the chorus?

What if you heard the song somewhere totally different?
What would it take to recognize it on a crowded street?

Or if you stripped it down to its most minimal parts, 
how much of the song would you need before you start to sing along.

# .white[Design Makes Communication Easier]

???

If you're anything like me, those last slides were distracting.
It was harder to follow what I was saying,
especially with the text in so many different places or 
so much visual information on the screen.

But you can use slide design to facilitate communication...

# Where can you apply design thinking?

.fl.w-20.b.tr.pr4[
Text
]
.fr.w-80[
Markdown or inline classes  
`.yellow[Watch out...]`
]

???

Use R Markdown and color consistently for specific words.
Can you think of any good examples?
(code vs packages)

Use xaringanthemer to set yourself up for success.

.fl.w-20.b.tr.pr4.cb[
Block

.fr.w-80[
Boxes or groups of content  
`.callout[ ... ]`
]

???

Boxes or groups of content. Example? `.pull-right`

Have to remember to apply it consistently,
so write your own classes with special meaning if it makes it easier.

.fl.w-20.b.tr.pr4.cb[
Slide
]
.fr.w-80[
Special kinds of slides  
`class: header_background`
]

???

Style the whole slide for special circumstances.
Examples: use `inverse` as a strong signal that you're changing topics.
Or we've used `header_background` from xaringanthemer to add a header to slides when it's *your turn* to do something.
