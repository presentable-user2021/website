# Make "accessible"<br>your default mindset

.f7[.pull-left[

We communicate effectively when we make our work .b[open] and .b[accessible] to a broad audience

Principles of [inclusive design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)
- Recognize exclusion
- Solve for one, extend to many
- Learn from diversity

<span role="img" aria-label="Something designed for a person who has one arm could be used just as effectively by a person with a temporary wrist injury or a new parent holding an infant"></span>

???
We are returning to this core idea after covering it in the section on effective communication, because the two are intertwined

- Recognizing exclusion helps us call on our humanity and powers of empathy

- By designing for someone with a permanent disability, someone with a situational limitation can also benefit

- pBy putting people at the center of our design process we learn from diverse perspectives and experiences

# Support images with text

### Figures and graphics should include text<br>that describes the visual (alternative text)

.pull-left[

.f7[
.b[Alt-text] allows the reader to understand an image without seeing it

.b[Screen readers] provide voice or braille access to computer text, including alt-text]

[2.6 Support images with text](https://www.authorea.com/users/152134/articles/206076-making-scientific-content-more-accessible/#author-label-imagetext)]

???
Screen readers like VoiceOver for MacOS or NVDA for Windows are used by blind people as well as people with low vision, cognitive disabilities, deafness or hard-of-hearing, motor disabilities, and others. 

Many screen reader users experience more than one disability.

Alt text is also helpful when an image will not load, like in cases of slow internet connectivity

## `r fa("tasks")` In practice: Add alt-text with Markdown `r fa("markdown")`

.pull-left[

.f7[
We can add alt-text to an image inserted with the `![]()` syntax

Insert it between the square brackets:

```md
![Ring-tailed lemurs with alternating black and white rings along the entire length of their tail](ring-tailed-lemur.jpg)
```
]]

![Ring-tailed lemurs with alternating black and white rings along the entire length of their tail](assets/img/05/ring-tailed-lemur.jpg)

## `r fa("tasks")` In practice: Add alt-text with RMarkdown <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/master/PNG/rmarkdown.png" alt="rmarkdown" width="40px">

.f6[
We can add alt-text to an R Markdown code chunk output with the `fig.alt=""` option

````r
```{r, fig.alt="Ring-tailed lemurs with alternating black and white rings along the entire length of their tail"}`r ''`
knitr::include_graphics("ring-tailed-lemur.jpg")
```
````

## `r fa("question-circle")` Is it a good idea to use the same alt-text for all images that are identical?

.pull-left[
### Not necessarily!

.f7[
To write effective alt-text we need to .b[consider the context]

What, if any, important information is the image supposed to communicate?

# Choose colors carefully

.pull-left[
.f7[

- Avoid using color as the .b[only] way to indicate priority or importance

- Check for .b[color independence] early and often by [simulating a grayscale display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector/Simulation)

- Check the colors in your palette for adequate [color contrast](https://webaim.org/articles/contrast/#intro)

# Check your color palette for contrast

- Use one of the following color contrast checkers

  - [Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) by WebAIM (recommended)
  
  - [A11Y Rocks Color Palette](https://a11yrocks.com/colorPalette/) by Matt Long
  
  - [Accessible color palette builder](https://toolness.github.io/accessible-color-matrix/) by Atul Varma
