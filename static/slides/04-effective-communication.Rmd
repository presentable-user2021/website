# Make "accessible"<br>your default mindset

.f7[.pull-left[

We communicate effectively when we make our work .b[open] and .b[accessible] to a broad audience

Principles of [inclusive design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/)
- Recognize exclusion
- Solve for one, extend to many
- Learn from diversity

Recognizing exclusion helps us call on our humanity and powers of empathy

By designing for someone with a permanent disability, someone with a situational limitation can also benefit

By putting people at the center of our design process we learn from diverse perspectives and experiences

.f6[
- Avoid writing a "wall of text," break up the content

- Add a visual aid if it will help carry the message

- Turn your visual into a larger background image

- If your text overlaps with the background image, consider using CSS styling to give your text a background for contrast

### `r fa("th-large")` Layout

### `r fa("th-list")` Structure
- Use headings and lists to provide hierarchy and organization

# Visual: Not Good

Meet the critically endangered blue-eyed black lemur (Eulemur flavifrons), a crowd favorite here at the DLC!

Blue-eyed black lemurs are the most distinctively sexually dichromatic of all the lemurs. Males are black with blue eyes, whereas females are orange-brown with blue eyes.

Hailing from the tropical subhumid forests of northwestern Madagascar, these rare lemurs are among the most threatened primates on Earth.

No use of slide or content classes

### Demo

Use of `name: visual-not-good`

```
---
name: visual-not-good

<slide content>

---
```

The `name` can then be used for internal linking like in the slide that brought us to this one
